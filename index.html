    <p class="txt">Chevening is funded by the FCDO and partner organisations. Our partners contribute by co-sponsoring scholarships in your country/territory. Due to their generosity, there are more opportunities to study in the UK. Although you can still apply to any UK university, whether they are a partner or not, if your application is successful and you have applied to study a course supported by one of our partners, you will be automatically considered for a co-sponsored Chevening Scholarship. Find out more about our partner organisations, the areas of study they support, and why they have committed to supporting Chevening where you are.</p>
